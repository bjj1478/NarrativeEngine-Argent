title Narrative Engine - Update

REM ============================================================
REM Self-copy guard: git pull can overwrite THIS .bat file while
REM it is running. When that happens, cmd loses its place in the
REM file and the window closes silently (pause never runs).
REM To prevent that, we copy this script to a temp file and run
REM from there, passing the real app folder as an argument.
REM ============================================================
if "%~1"=="__tempcopy__" (
    set "APP_DIR=%~2"
    goto :begin
)
set "TEMP_BAT=%TEMP%\narrative_engine_updater_tmp.bat"
copy /y "%~f0" "%TEMP_BAT%" >nul 2>nul
if exist "%TEMP_BAT%" (
    "%TEMP_BAT%" __tempcopy__ "%~dp0"
    REM exit /b with no code passes through the temp copy's exit
    REM code; %errorlevel% here would expand before the copy runs.

REM ============================================================
REM Repository identity - the ONLY fork-specific thing in this
REM file. The updater pulls from one known repository on purpose:
REM a remote nobody recognizes could pull code that then runs on
REM the next start. If this app is forked again, change these
REM three lines and nothing else.
REM   REPO_SLUG - matched against every configured git remote
REM   REPO_URL  - offered for re-cloning when no remote matches
REM   REPO_NAME - how to refer to it in the messages below
REM Keep parentheses out of REPO_NAME: it is echoed inside an
REM if-block, where an unescaped one would end the block early.
REM ============================================================

echo   Narrative Engine - Update Tool
echo ============================================
echo.
echo This tool downloads the latest version of
echo the app from GitHub and updates the files
echo in this folder.
echo.
echo It will:
echo   - Download the newest app files
echo   - Update dependencies if needed
echo   - Leave your saved campaigns and settings
echo     untouched
echo.
echo IMPORTANT: Before continuing, please make
echo sure the Narrative Engine app is fully closed:
echo   - Close any app windows
echo   - Close any black terminal/command windows
echo     that say "Narrative Engine" in the title
echo   - If you ran "npm run dev" in a terminal,
echo     close that terminal
echo.
echo ============================================

REM ===== Pre-flight: is the app still running? =====
REM Checks both the frontend (5173) and backend server (3001)
REM ports. The [^0-9] guard stops ":5173" from also matching
REM ports like 15173 or 51737.
echo Checking whether the app is still running...

echo ============================================
echo   [STOP] The app appears to still be running
echo ============================================
echo.
echo One of the app's ports (5173 or 3001) is busy,
echo which means the Narrative Engine is probably
echo still open. Updating while it is running can
echo cause file-lock errors on Windows and corrupt
echo the update.
echo.
echo Please close the app completely:
echo   - Close any browser tabs showing the app
echo   - Close any black terminal/command windows
echo     that say "Narrative Engine" in the title
echo   - If you ran "npm run dev" in a terminal,
echo     close that terminal
echo.
echo Then double-click this file again.

echo Most users already have it from when they
echo first installed the app. If you do not:
echo.
echo   1. Open your web browser and go to

REM ===== Pre-flight: this folder must be a git repo =====
REM NOTE: goto-based on purpose. An unescaped ) inside an echo line
REM ends a parenthesized if-block early and corrupts the script, so
REM message text with parentheses must live outside ( ) blocks.

echo [STOP] This folder is not a Git repository.

echo This updater only works if the app was
echo installed by cloning it from GitHub. If you
echo downloaded it as a ZIP file, you cannot use
echo this updater - download the newest ZIP from
echo GitHub instead.
echo.
echo If you cloned the app but moved it to a new
echo folder, that is fine - just make sure you
echo are running this file from inside the app
echo folder (the one that contains package.json).

echo Checking your files for unsaved changes...
echo.
REM NOTE: this section must stay goto-based, NOT a parenthesized
REM if-block. Inside a ( ) block, %CONFIRM% expands when the block
REM is parsed - before set /p runs - so the YES check would always
REM see an empty string and always cancel.

echo ============================================
echo   [WARNING] You have unsaved changes
echo ============================================
echo.
echo Some files in this folder have been edited
echo and are different from the original download.
echo Updating now could overwrite your edits.
echo.
echo Common safe edits:
echo   - Files inside the "data" folder
echo     (your saved campaigns and settings)
echo     These are NOT tracked by Git and will
echo     never be touched by the update.
echo   - Files inside the "Example_Setup" folder
echo     that you copied and renamed
echo.
echo If the only changes listed below are inside
echo "data" or are copies you made, it is safe
echo to continue.
echo.
echo ---- Changed files ----

echo -----------------------
echo.

set /p CONFIRM="Type YES to overwrite these edits and update, or any other key and Enter to cancel: "
if /i not "%CONFIRM%"=="YES" goto :user_cancelled
echo.
echo Overwriting local edits and continuing...
REM reset --hard also discards staged (git add-ed) edits, which
REM checkout -- . would silently leave behind. Untracked files
REM like the data folder are never touched by either.
git reset --hard
echo.

REM ===== Pull the latest code =====
echo ============================================
echo   Downloading the latest version...
echo ============================================
echo.

echo ============================================
echo   Download complete.
echo ============================================

REM ===== Sync dependencies =====
echo Running npm install to keep dependencies in sync...
echo (This is safe even if nothing changed - it just
echo checks and skips any work that is not needed.)
echo.
call npm install
if errorlevel 1 goto :install_failed
echo.

REM ===== Build the local engine package =====
REM The app imports @narrative/engine from packages/engine, whose
REM compiled dist/ output is git-ignored. npm install does not
REM reliably rebuild an already-linked local package, so without
REM this step the app can fail on startup with:
REM   Failed to resolve import "@narrative/engine"
if not exist "packages\engine\package.json" goto :engine_done
echo Building the game engine...
echo.
call npm run build --prefix packages/engine
if errorlevel 1 goto :engine_build_failed

echo.
echo Engine build complete - OK.

REM ===== Done =====
echo ============================================
echo   Update complete!
echo ============================================
echo.
echo Your app is now up to date. Your saved
echo campaigns and settings were not touched.
echo.
echo Next step: double-click Start_Narrative_Engine.bat
echo (in this same folder) to start the app.

:pull_failed
echo.
echo ============================================
echo   The download did not finish.
echo ============================================
echo.
echo This is usually one of two things:
echo.
echo   1. A network problem - check your internet
echo      connection and try again.
echo.
echo   2. A merge conflict - you edited files that
echo      the update also changed. If you are not
echo      sure what to keep, you can force the
echo      update by typing the following two
echo      commands in this window:
echo         git reset --hard
echo         git pull
echo      This will overwrite ANY local edits to
echo      app files (but never your saved campaigns
echo      in the "data" folder).
echo.
pause
exit /b 1

:engine_build_failed
echo.
echo ============================================
echo   The engine build did not finish.
echo ============================================
echo.
echo The app files were downloaded, but one part
echo of the app - the game engine - could not be
echo compiled. The app will not start until this
echo is fixed - you would see an error mentioning
echo "@narrative/engine" if you tried.
echo.
echo Your saved campaigns and settings are safe.
echo.
echo What to do:
echo   1. Run this updater again - this can be a
echo      one-off problem.
echo   2. If it fails again, take a screenshot or
echo      photo of ALL the text in this window -
echo      especially any lines containing the word
echo      "error" - and send it to support.
echo.
pause

:install_failed
echo.
echo ============================================
echo   Dependency update did not finish.
echo ============================================
echo.
echo The app code was updated, but "npm install"
echo failed. You can still try starting the app -
echo it may work with the old dependencies.
echo.
echo If it does not start, run Repair_Narrative_Engine.bat
echo (in this same folder) and choose option 2
echo (Full clean reinstall).
echo.
pause
exit /b 1

:user_cancelled
echo.
echo Cancelled. No changes were made to your computer.
echo You can run this file again any time.

REM ===== Safety net: if execution ever falls through
REM      to here (should not happen), still pause so the

REM ===== Subroutine: mark the first matching remote as the pull source =====
REM Called once per line of `git remote -v`, so %1 is the remote name and %2
REM its URL. First match wins, which keeps working if an `upstream` remote is
REM later added alongside `origin` - only the fork is ever pulled from.
