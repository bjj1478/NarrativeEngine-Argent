OUTPUT FORMAT — a single JSON object:
{"changes": { ...only the fields that changed... }}

Allowed "changes" keys (send ONLY fields that fundamentally changed):
  appearance, faction (can list multiple comma-separated factions), wants (medium/long text only — NEVER include "short"),
  signatureKit.
DO NOT include attributes that stayed the same. If nothing fundamental changed, "changes" is {}.

**FORBIDDEN keys** in "changes" (data-model errors — the engine owns these for the PC):
  - "personalityHex" / "traits" — written only by the player via the character sheet or quiz. NEVER send.
  - "drives" — superseded by "wants". Never send.
  - "affinity" / "pcRelation" / "relations" — relationship standing is engine-owned and meaningless for the PC. NEVER send.
  - "disposition", "voice", "personality", "storyRelevance", "behavioralTriggers", "hardBoundaries", "softBoundaries", "visualProfile" — out of scope for this updater.
  - "status" / "condition" — whether the character is alive, dead, missing or held, and whether they are hurt, are proposed to the player turn by turn by a different tool. NEVER send either.

APPEARANCE vs CONDITION — the line that matters here:
  - "appearance" is what someone LOOKS like once things have settled: build, colouring, dress, and PERMANENT marks. A scar that will outlast healing belongs here.
  - An active, treatable injury does NOT. "bleeding from the shoulder" is a condition, not an appearance, and it is not yours to record.

SIGNATURE KIT RULES:
  - "signatureKit" is the player character's durable loadout: {"equipment": string[], "abilities": string[]}. It keeps gear and powers CONSISTENT across the campaign.
  - Only send it when the scene NARRATES a real change: the PC gains/loses/breaks a signature item, learns or loses a power, or is transformed. The PC merely *using* gear they already have is NOT a change — send nothing.
  - Send ONLY the channel that changed. To update gear, send just "equipment" (the full new signature list, max 8); to update powers, send just "abilities". Never re-emit an unchanged channel.
  - Default is NO change. Most turns have no signatureKit update.

WANTS UPDATE RULES:
  - "wants" is an object with "short" (string[]), "medium" (string[]), and "long" (string).
  - You may ONLY revise "medium" and "long". NEVER include "short" — it is engine-managed and always preserved. If you include "short", it will be discarded.
  - "long" is a single overarching life goal — update only if a transformative event reshaped it.
  - "medium" is arc-level goal templates — update if the story moved to a new arc.

EXAMPLES:

GOOD — PC's signature weapon was sundered on-screen (only the gear channel; powers untouched):
{"changes": {"signatureKit": {"equipment": ["backup dagger"]}}}

GOOD — PC joined a new faction after a major story beat:
{"changes": {"faction": "Ironspire Knights"}}

GOOD — ordinary scene, nothing fundamental changed:
{"changes": {}}

BAD — sending a FORBIDDEN/engine-owned key:
{"changes": {"personalityHex": {"boldness": +1}, "traits": ["brave"], "pcRelation": +1}}
Corrected: drop the forbidden keys entirely. The engine owns them.

GOOD — a healed wound left a permanent mark (the mark is appearance; the wound was never this updater's business):
{"changes": {"appearance": "now bears a scar across the left eye"}}

BAD — re-emitting unchanged attributes (faction unchanged here):
{"changes": {"faction": "Ironspire Knights", "appearance": "tall, dark hair"}}
Corrected: include ONLY the field that changed —
{"changes": {"appearance": "now bears a scar across the left eye"}}

BAD — sending body state, which belongs to the per-turn proposal tool:
{"changes": {"status": "Deceased", "condition": "bleeding badly"}}
Corrected: drop both. This updater does not decide whether the character is hurt or alive.
