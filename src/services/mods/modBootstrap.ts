/**
 * Project 2 / Phase 1.5 — loads installed mods and registers them as
 * contribution modules, compute tracks, and native-tier lifecycle hooks.
 *
 * This is the only place the mod layer meets the payload layer, and it pushes
 * rather than pulls (see `contributions/extensions.ts`). Call `refreshMods()`
 * at app start and again whenever the user installs, edits, or removes a mod
 * file — the server reads disk per request, so no restart is needed on either
 * side.
 *
 * Phase 1.5 wiring:
 *   • The `createNativeLoader` builds the asset URLs and `import()`s them.
 *   • The `createLifecycleHost` owns hook firing, fault containment, and CSS
 *     mount/unmount (via the native loader).
 *   • `refreshMods` runs the load cycle for every enabled mod with a `native`
 *     block, in the loader's resolved order.
 *
 * The lifecycle host and native loader are module-level singletons, created
 * lazily on first `refreshMods`. Tests that need a fresh instance use
 * `vi.resetModules()` and re-import; the `__resetLifecycleHost` seam is
 * exported for the bootstrap tests so they do not have to reach into module
 * state.

/**
 * Phase 6.4 / `DATA_POLICY.md` §3 — the clean action, in the order the

 *
 *   1. the mod's `clean` hook runs, removing data the host does not know it
 *      owns (context keys, caches, anything outside its declared tables);
 *   2. **then the host removes the mod's provisioned tables itself,
 *      unconditionally** — whether `clean` returned, threw, timed out, or was
 *      never declared. A declarative or sandboxed mod cannot declare hooks at
 *      all, and still gets a complete clear;
 *   3. the store drops the mod's in-memory rows so the UI stops serving data
 *      that is no longer on disk.
 *
 * Step 2 does not depend on step 1's result on purpose. A mod that throws in
 * `clean` must not be able to keep its data alive — that would hand a broken
 * mod a veto over the user's decision to erase it.
 *
 * This is the ONLY caller of `clearModData`, and it is reachable only from an
 * explicit user action with a confirmation. It is never called from a toggle,
 * from delete-detection, or from an app update.
 *
 * Throws if the server clear fails: the caller must be able to tell the user
 * the data is still there. A failing `clean` hook does NOT throw — the host
 * contains it as a surfaced fault, as it does everywhere else.
