/**
 * Phase 2.3 — `buildModContext(mod, facade)`.
 *
 * The implementation of the `getContext()` v1 surface designed in `API.md` (Phase
 * 2.2). A mod talks to a `ModContext`; a mod NEVER imports from `src/`. The
 * host constructs one `ModContext` per mod per lease and hands it over at every
 * lifecycle hook, compute run, and (Phase 4+) render.
 *
 * This file is a **wrapper over `hostFacade.ts`**, not a parallel implementation
 * (2.3 §2.4). `HostFacade` stays internal and carries fields `ModContext` does
 * not expose; that gap is the point of the exercise. The frozen/cloned reads
 * stay frozen (2.3 §3) — `cloneAndFreeze` in `hostFacade.ts:176` is the existing
 * discipline and it is kept here.
 *
 * The surface is exactly the one in `API.md` §3. No extra fields, no "while we're
 * here" additions. If something is missing, that is a change to `API.md` first.
 *
 * Version: `ctx.api.version` equals the app version. The loader already rejected
 * a mismatch on `appVersion` before any mod code ran (`API.md` §2), so by the
 * time a `ModContext` exists, compatibility was settled.
