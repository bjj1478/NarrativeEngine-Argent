/**
 * WO 6.5 — shared departure-flow helper. Travel is now an engine action: the
 * first press departs (creating the journey state and landing on camp 1), and
 * no LLM turn runs. This module owns the shared path so all three entry points
 * (map, Places panel, composer TRAVEL) produce the identical `TransitionResult`.
 *
 * It does NOT touch the Zustand store directly: the caller passes the ledger
 * data and the store actions it wants applied. Pure with respect to data,
 * side-effecting only through the supplied callbacks — so it is unit-testable
 * without a store.
 *
 * The composer strip's picker shows a list of candidates. `travellableFrom`
 * returns the destinations the player may pick, with the connection band
 * already resolved. Transit nodes and the current place are excluded.
