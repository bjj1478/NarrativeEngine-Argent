 * the engine posts its own `role: 'system'` line at each checkpoint.
 *
 * This module is the single place that orchestrates a travel press. The three
 * entry points (map, Places panel, composer TRAVEL) all call `composeDeparture`
 * for the first press; subsequent presses call `advanceLeg`. The system message
 * is posted here so the entry points do not diverge.
