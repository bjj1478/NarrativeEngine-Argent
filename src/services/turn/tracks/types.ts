/**
 * Project 2 / WO-P2-03 — the post-turn track contract.
 *
 * ┌─ WHY THIS IS NOT `ContributionSpec` ───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 * │ `payload/contributions/types.ts` describes a *prompt contribution*: rendered text that  │
 * │ competes for room under a token budget, resolved synchronously while the payload is     │
 * │ assembled. A post-turn track is the opposite shape: scheduled async work that calls a   │
 * │ utility model and writes to a store slice. It has no text, no budget, no ordering       │
 * │ against other contributions, and it cannot be trimmed.                                  │
 * │                                                                                         │
 * │ Forcing one type over both would mean a union with half its fields unused on either     │
 * │ side — the same "knows every feature by name" rot the project exists to remove. They    │
 * │ deliberately stay two types that happen to share the `id / name / toggleable /          │
 * │ defaultEnabled` metadata the extensions screen needs.                                   │
