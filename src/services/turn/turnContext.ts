// WO-P1-01 §4.1 — TurnContext data bus.
//
// A single mutable object threaded through the turn pipeline, replacing the
// `finalInput += …` string-gluing, the ~14 loose vars destructured out of
// `gatherContext`, and (per Q2) the ~29 positional args to `buildPayload`.
//
// This is NOT a parallel shape to TurnState: TurnState is the CALLER-supplied
// snapshot of campaign-level state at turn start; TurnContext is the EVOLVING
// per-turn working set — engine-roll appends, gathered context, the assembled
// payload, watchdog/director nudges, etc. Stages write onto it; downstream
// stages read from it.
//
// Reuses existing value types — declares NO new duplicate types. The
// `GatheredContext` import is the type returned by `gatherContext`; the bus
// folds the whole object in rather than destructuring it into 14 locals.
//
// Location: `src/services/turn/` (client — holds React/Zustand-adjacent
// shapes; NOT `packages/engine` — the bus isn't pure).

/**
 * Phase 3.2 — the `turnId` source. A per-session monotonic counter, **not**
 * `uid()`.
 *
 * `EVENTS.md` §7.1 suggests "a `uid()` alongside the existing fields", and that
 * is a defect the Phase 0.2 base-app gate caught on the first run: `uid()` is
 * `Date.now().toString(36) + Math.random()…`, so minting one here consumes a
 * draw from the RNG that `rollEngines` reads two stages later. Every dice
 * outcome in the canonical turn moved. Emitting an event must not change what
 * the app does (3.2 §3), and a correlation key that perturbs the dice is a
 * changed base-app behaviour, not a side effect.
 *
 * A counter is also the better key on the merits: `turnId` only has to correlate
 * `turn.generated` with `turn.committed` inside one page load — the snapshot
 * that carries it is in-memory, and after a crash the id is `null` by
 * construction (§7.1). No clock dependence, no collision window.
