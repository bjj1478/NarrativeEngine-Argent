/**
 * Project 2 / WO-P2-05 — the Extensions screen (Phase 6.1: Mod Management).
 *
 * Lists every prompt-contribution module the user may switch off, built-in and installed,
 * and writes the result to `settings.moduleEnabled`. That map is already the enablement
 * predicate `buildPayload` passes to `registry.collect`, so a toggle here takes effect on the
 * next turn with no other wiring — this screen owns the WRITE side and nothing else.
 *
 * Three rules this file must keep:
 *
 *  1. ABSENT MEANS ENABLED. `payloadBuilder` reads `moduleEnabled?.[id] !== false`, so the
 *     checkbox must too. Reading `?? defaultEnabled` instead would draw a checkbox that
 *     disagrees with the prompt for any module that ever defaults to off.
 *  2. STRUCTURAL MODULES ARE NOT OPTIONS. `toggleable === false` marks the player's own
 *     message, the world-state block, the confirmed ask-GM handoff, and the player's absolute
 *     command. They are the prompt, not features, and `collect` ignores the predicate for
 *     them — rendering them (even disabled) would advertise a switch that does nothing.
 *  3. FAULTS ARE VISIBLE. A rejected mod file is shown with its reason (acceptance criterion
 *     5). A broken mod that silently disappears is indistinguishable from one that never
 *     installed, which is the failure mode the fail-safe design exists to avoid. Phase 6.1
 *     surfaces the reason INLINE, next to the mod it rejected, not in a separate section a
 *     user must know to scroll to.
