// Phase 4.2 — the Arc Engine's native-tier entry point.
//
// `MOUNTS.md` §2.3: the arc mod's "Inject Arc" button returns as a
// mod-claimed `composer.actions` entry registered from `activate`, NOT as
// host chrome. This is where `mods/arc/compute.js:14-20` always said it
// belonged ("stays host-side until PANELS/SCREENS" — Phase 4 is PANELS).
//
// What lives here: the `activate` hook that registers the composer entry,
// and the spawn logic (the +1 LLM call) that the entry's `onSelect` fires.
// The spawn logic duplicates `src/services/arc/arcSpawn.ts` because a mod
// never imports from `src/` — the same way `compute.js` duplicates the tick
// logic and constants from `src/services/arc/`. The prompt and validation
// are byte-identical to `arcSpawn.ts`; the constants are shared with
// `compute.js` by duplication (locked by the WO-01 contract).
//
// What stays host-side: nothing. The un-parking (Phase 4.0) restored the
// button as a temporary host-owned mount; 4.2 removes that and the mod owns
// the whole surface now. `ArcInjectorButton.tsx`, `arcSpawn.ts`,
// `openThreads.ts` stay in `src/` because other host code may still
// reference them, but the running app's Inject Arc button is THIS mod
// entry, not the host component.
//
// `ctx.data.chapters` (Phase 4.0 / API.md §4.4) carries the sealed chapters
// the spawn reads for open threads. `ctx.model.call('story', …)` is the LLM
// call. `ctx.table.read('arcs')` / `ctx.table.write('arcs', …)` are the
// mod's own table. `ctx.data.npcLedger` carries the NPC pressure. The
// pending-commit drain (MOUNTS.md §8.8) is handled by the host before
// `onSelect` fires, so the mod does not commit a turn itself (CONTRACT.md
// L3).
//
// ── Phase 5.1 decision: the `{{arcSurface}}` contribution is removed ──
// The manifest used to declare a contribution with `text: "{{arcSurface}}"`
// at order 820. Nothing resolved `{{arcSurface}}` — `renderTemplate`
// understood only `{{location}}` and `{{npcs}}`, so the literal string
// `{{arcSurface}}` was being emitted into the prompt at order 820 whenever
// Arc was enabled. Arc's REAL surfacing path goes through
// `ctx.write.updateContext({ arcDigest })` in `compute.js:446`, which the
// world builder reads at `src/services/payload/world.ts:560` and emits as
// `[WORLD PRESSURES — developing situations]` wrapping ${arcDigest} — a
// host-owned, host-coupled path.
//
// Phase 5.1's macro registry COULD have registered `arcSurface` as a macro,
// but doing so would require exposing `context.arcDigest` on `ModData` (a
// new API surface) just to duplicate the world block `world.ts:560` already
// emits — emitting `[WORLD PRESSURES]` twice (once from the world
// builder, once from the macro at order 820) would be a regression, not a
// fix. The `arcDigest` → `world.ts:560` path is load-bearing AND
// host-coupled; Phase 8.3 ("logic and prompt move") owns moving that path
// into the mod. Phase 5.1's job is the macro registry, not pre-empting
// 8.3's architectural decision.
//
// Decision: REMOVE the dead contribution. This fixes the live bug (the
// literal `{{arcSurface}}` is no longer emitted) and is reversible — when
// 8.3 moves the surfacing path into the mod, the mod can register an
// `arcSurface` macro through `ctx.macros.register()` at that point.

The arc is GROUNDED in the single anchor below — its seed grows out of that one NPC's want OR that one open thread, not out of the whole world at once.

- SYSTEMIC + INDIRECT, NOT A STRANGER WALKING UP. The seed is a STANDING CONDITION in the world — a harvest failure, a regent's decree, a faction consolidating, a cult spreading, a syndicate cornering a market, a plague rumored in a distant port. It does NOT open with someone approaching the player at their current location. The opening hook is something the player hears about, notices in a price, or learns through rumor — never something that arrives at them.
- WORSENS OVER TIME. Each rung is the same condition one step further along. Rung 0 is distant and quiet; the final rung is the crisis landing in the player's lap. The ladder is the arc — it must feel like ONE thread tightening, not a sequence of unrelated events.
- GROUNDED IN THE ANCHOR ONLY. The seed grows from the single anchor (one NPC's want OR one open thread) below. Do NOT pull in the whole world. The anchor is the root; the ladder is what its consequences become.
- EARLY RUNGS ARE QUIET. The first 1–2 rungs should be 'ambient' (a price shift, a background detail, a distant report). Middle rungs 'rumor' (a merchant mentions it, a traveler brings word). Only the last 1–2 rungs are 'direct' (it arrives in the player's scene — a riot, a lockdown, a death they witness). The crisis is EARNED by the quiet rungs beneath it.
- TROUBLE, NOT A GIFT. The arc is a threat, pressure, complication, ticking-clock, or escalation. Never a free opportunity or a reward.
- AVOID SUPPRESSED TYPES. The type you pick MUST NOT be one of: ${suppressedLine}. Pick a different flavor.
- 5–12 RUNGS, NO MORE, NO LESS.
- NO PROSE AROUND THE JSON. No markdown fences. No explanation. Just the object.`,
